# project6-Static_NodeJS_and_ExpressSite

Project Overview
So far I have worked with a lot of client-side JavaScript. All of the JavaScript I have written for the first five projects in this Techdegree is run right in the browser. For this project, it is to continue my journey out of the browser and start writing some server-side JavaScript.

In this project, I created a portfolio site to showcase the projects I have built. The site contains a modern landing page, a little about myself, and a series of project pages to show my first five projects from this Techdegree bootcamp.

Created a JSON file to store all the data about the projects I have created.

Used Pug to complete provided templates that utilize the JSON to generate the markup that is displayed in the browser.

Used Node.js and Express to:

Import the required dependencies
Link the JSON with the Pug templates
Set up routes to handle requests
Set up the middleware to utilize static files like CSS
Handle errors
Set up a server to serve the project
